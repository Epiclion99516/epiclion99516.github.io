### About me
I'm a Chicago-based recent BFA Film and Television graduate with a cinematography concentration and hands-on experience in professional camera systems, lighting design, and post-production. I'm passionate about crafting immersive visual stories for digital and short-form platforms and open to full-time, part-time, or freelance work.
